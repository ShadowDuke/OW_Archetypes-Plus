- ### Info

   - Every family have given a chance to gain the new archetypes (e.g. families focused on research become likely easier Sky Explorers than families focused on war)
   - During studies theres a slight chance you are going to be a Corruptionist or Sky Explorer (except tactics studies)
      - The chance is always below 100% for every added chance for an archetype to become
   - Ministers have a chance of the new archetypes
   - 1 new great person: **Great Stargazer**
   - 1 completely **new event** for astronomy studies added (giving 2 answer options)
   - Added extra answer options to some events
