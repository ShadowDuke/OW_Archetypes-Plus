# Important Info
**The game is now using [mod.io](https://oldworld.mod.io/) for mod-support in their game which was implemented with the latest patch (20th July).<br>
You can still add them manually like before (github) but it would be certainly easier for you to create a [mod.io](https://oldworld.mod.io/) profile and get the mods and updates for them through the game now.**

- ### Info

   - Every family has given a chance to gain the new archetypes (e.g. families focused on research become likely easier Sky Explorers than families focused on war)
   - During studies theres a slight chance you are going to be one of the new archetypes
      - The chance is always below 100% for every added chance for an archetype to become
   - Every named (real) character was looked through and a lot of them were given the "Famous Person" trait
   - Ministers have a chance of the new archetypes
   - 3 new great persons: **Great Stargazer**, **Great Artist** & **Great Famous Person**
   - 1 completely **new event** for astronomy studies added (giving 2 answer options)
   - 5 completely new events for historical characters added (everyone have different triggers, so just play and find out or look at the event browser ^^)
   - Added a bunch of new events for trait probabilities
   - Added extra answer options to some vanilla events
   - Added some character portraits
