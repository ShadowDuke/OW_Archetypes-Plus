- ### Info

   - Every family have given a chance to gain the new archetypes (e.g. families focused on research become likely easier Sky Explorers than families focused on war)
   - During studies theres a slight chance you are going to be one of the new archetypes
      - The chance is always below 100% for every added chance for an archetype to become
   - Every named (real) character was looked through and a lof of them were given the "Famous Person" trait
   - Ministers have a chance of the new archetypes
   - 2 new great persons: **Great Stargazer** & **Great Famous Person**
   - 1 completely **new event** for astronomy studies added (giving 2 answer options)
   - Added a bunch of new events for trait probabilities
   - Added extra answer options to some events

## Notes
You might want to start one higher difficulty level as usually.
~~- I mainly set up the string structure to make it easier for the upcoming changes.~~
~~- So, these values are not final and barely touched, mainly testing the waters here.~~
